# DAY-3 Part-2

- who this person is 
- how you know this person
- how this person helped you

and explain how you feel about this person.(必须说)

e.g.- ok so i'm gonna talk about a kind of bag i wanna own.

## Method 1
>分成： 1.背景介绍30秒（开头，时间、地点、人物），2.扣题描述60秒（first第一点描述+评价、second第二点描述+评价、but what's most i ... + modifier但是最怎么怎么的是），3.总结概括30秒（anyways..., 积极感受、消极感受、拉回）,最后一句话要强调关键词（例如题目中exciting），

# DAY-4 Part-3

可以问他中间某个词什么意思
可以说i don't know 让他换题

## discourse and important tools
talk about groups, 举例用一群人，不要用身边人或者我，例如将我喜欢书换成大多数年轻人喜欢书

不需要high-level，可以往time, money, energy, feelings, personality上考虑，而不是可扩展性解释比较等高级点

说了个观点需要给出理由，每个观点都要有why，除了universally acknowledge facts

不会说的词说上意词、下意词（high/low-level words）

最后要有总结，顺序大概是mid-mind->detailed->high=level,需要有分层的层次感


一开口需要说一句“正确的废话”，保证流利度，不要沉默不语的思考，例如
Q: What kind's of toys do children like to play?
A: Well, i think there are a lot of toys children like to play with...
