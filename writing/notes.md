# day 2 structure
不要列表式的写作，需要详细描述细节，跟写论文差不多

每一段point：
High level -> mid level -> detail (和口语part3相反，像一个金字塔)

# day 3 opening
开头 intriguing coherent and clear.
例如先给hook，再转折Transition，再给出points

e.g. 
**hook**: social issues related to gender have been widely discussed among people over centuries. Due to gender differences, some people have claimed that certain jobs should accept either men or women.
**Transition**: However, such a statement suffers from logical and factual problems.
**Points**: I hardly agree with this one-sided proposal.

开头公式：
It is hard to deny that (opposite detail) and such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that (opposite response).
However, such a statement suffers from both logical and factual fallacies, and it should be examined meticulously.
As far as (Point 1), (Point 2), and (Point 3) are concerned, I strongly hold that (our response).

# Part 1
首先区分动态图（有变化趋势，例如时间,**注意时态**）和静态图
（还有少部分地图题、流程图）

## Dynamic Charts
### 分析
step 1 -- summary: what is the **general** trend?

step 2 -- grouping: What are the major commonalities and differences between trends?

step 3 -- analysis: What are the key features of each group?

### 框架
 1. summary: 1. what's the framework? 2. what's the general trend?
    第一句改写题目换一种方式表示（换词不要照抄），第二句再给图的大趋势

 2. group 1：1. why grouping? 2. key features and comparison  of line graphs?
 3. group 2: 1. why grouping? 2. key features and comparison of line graphs?
 4. conclusion 可有可无(bonus)
